This repository contains the code accompanying the paper “Space-use and
social organization in a gregarious ungulate: testing the conspecific
attraction and resource dispersion”. Scripts are under `scripts/` and
reused functions are in `R/`. This project uses standard R package
structure and can therefore be installed with `devtools`. This also
helps declare external package dependencies required for the analysis.
Please note that while functions are included here, they are not tested
for use in other projects and may not be suitable (at least not in their
current version).
